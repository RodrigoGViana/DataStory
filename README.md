 "Data Visualization for All" Embedded charts

## Here we go
First things first, the data set I used is the one for [_Student Enrollment as of March 6th_](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/be80302194af644ee266eb2175507a6c/asset-v1:TrinityX+T005x+1T2017+type@asset+block/dataviz-enrollment-march6.ods).

The idea was to relate genders and nationalities from the data, therefore I made the following chart:

*This seems not good enough, do you agree?* So let's take into account just nations with 10 or more enrolled students and avoid using incomplete data.

I guess this was a quite standard idea so I look forward to see more interesting charts.
