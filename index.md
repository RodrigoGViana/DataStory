## Data Visualization for All

While trying to come out with something for this week's assignment, my first choice was to use [this data set](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/be80302194af644ee266eb2175507a6c/asset-v1:TrinityX+T005x+1T2017+type@asset+block/dataviz-enrollment-march6.ods)
 and thus, the chart I came out with was:

**Not good enough?** I agree and therefore I tried the following

This time it shows only those nations with 10 or more students enrolled, **does that make any sense to you?** I hope it does.
